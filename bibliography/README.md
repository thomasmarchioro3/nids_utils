# NIDS bibliography


The objective of this section is to mention relevant publications and summarize their contributions to NIDS knowledge.

Unfortunately, results in NIDS publications are often over-stated and evaluation metrics, such as detection accuracy, precision, and so on, are often inflated by methodological errors (see [Methodology](bibliography/Methodology/)).
It should be noted that these issues cannot be entirely attributed to the authors, as the review process often tends to select papers with outstanding results over a rigorous methodology.

Additionally, new publications often highlight mistakes or shortcomings of previous ones, allowing for a more objective assessment of their results. 


Publications are included accordinh to the following criteria (ALL must apply):
- [x] Open access
- [x] Highly influential (100+ citations) OR published in a top conference/journal*

\*A/A\* according to [ICORE](https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/) or Q1 for "Networks and Communications" according to [Scimago](https://www.scimagojr.com) 

Additionally, some papers may be excluded based on the following criteria:
- Not providing any contribution to NIDS, not even as a legacy approach (e.g., papers published during the neural network hype period, during which any slightly modified architecture could be published and get a large number of citations)
- Basic methodological mistakes (e.g., not splitting the dataset in training and test sets, tuning hyperparameters on the test set)

To contribute a paper (or if you are an author and you want your paper to be removed) please contact the owner of this repository.
Also, please report any errors/inaccuracies in the summaries.
