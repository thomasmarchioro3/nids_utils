### Liu L, Engelen G, Lynar T, Essam D, Joosen W. Error prevalence in nids datasets: A case study on cic-ids-2017 and cse-cic-ids-2018. IEEE CNS. 2022.

Dataset: [Updated CIC-IDS-2017 and CIC-IDS-2018](https://intrusion-detection.distrinet-research.be/CNS2022/index.html)

Issues in the datasets:
- Wrong labels: Some flows were mislabeled, and some attacks were entirely missed (e.g., rounds of port scanning)
- Errors in CICFlowMeter led to incorrect calculations of some features (e.g., flow duration, data rates) due to timestamp issues (e.g., within a same flow a SYN ACK timestamp would precede a SYN due to inconsistent times between different machines). 

Fixes:
- Fixed labels
- Fixed incorrect features (modified CICFlowMeter and recalculated features)
- Addition of stateful features/attributes (total flow duration, ICMP features, fwd/bwd RST flag counts)

Dataset: [CIC-IDS-2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)

- CIC-IDS-2017 aims to meet the following criteria (missing in previous datasets, like KDD '99): attack diversity, protocol variety, feature richness, metadata inclusion, and complete traffic capture.
- Attacks
- Realistic benign traffic generated by profiling 25 real users and monitoring their interactions across multiple protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, email).
- Testbed architecture includes various OS (Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Ubuntu 12, Ubuntu 16, Mac) and network components (firewalls, routers, switches).
- Flow features extracted using CICFlowMeter.

Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, email

OS: Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Ubuntu 12, Ubuntu 16, Mac
